**CSV Quick Stats** is a high-performance data management terminal developed with **Flutter**, designed to analyze complex datasets in seconds, extract core statistics, and perform structural comparisons between data files.

Unlike standard spreadsheet tools, **CSV Quick Stats** focuses on data "health." It processes heavy data manipulation algorithms in the background without freezing the UI, offers a modern **Glassmorphism** design language, and securely processes all your data entirely on your local device.

## ✨ Key Features

CSV Quick Stats is not just a utility; it is a reflection of modern software engineering principles.

### 🧠 Intelligent Data Analysis
* **Statistical Engine:** Automatically calculates column-based unique values, averages, min/max ranges, and identifies data types.
* **Data Health Audit:** * **Empty Cell Detection:** Instantly identifies missing data and visualizes it with cyber-red highlights.
    * **Duplicate Detection:** Mathematically analyzes duplicate rows and provides options for data cleaning.
* **Dynamic Comparison:** Structural comparison between different datasets with instant reporting of discrepancies.

### 🔄 Interactive Data Management
* **In-Place Editing:** Real-time, cell-based data updates directly through the table interface.
* **Structural Operations:** Dynamically delete unnecessary columns and rows to streamline your data.
* **Export Capability:** Save analyzed, cleaned, and edited data back into standard CSV format.

### 💎 Modern UI/UX Architecture
* **Glassmorphism Design:** A futuristic interface crafted with translucent panels, blur effects, and deep gradients.
* **Cyber-Terminal Aesthetics:** A high-contrast dark mode theme optimized for data-centric workflows.
* **Fluid Performance:** Heavy computational tasks run independently from the main thread, ensuring 60 FPS smooth animations and a lag-free table experience.
